# ConwayDefenseSystem
☆~a unique experience that is truly magical and utterly breathtaking~☆

Conway Defense System utilizes Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automata invented by John Conway.  The game of life lead to many discoveries including the turing machine.  This game uses the game of life as a simulation of growth, with the objective being to keep the growth of cells from reaching the center.  Following are the rules to Conway's Game of Life:
1. Every alive cell with 2 or 3 neighbors survives
2. Every dead cell with exactly 3 neighbors gets born
3. All other cells die or stay dead

RIP to my boy John Conway. He kept it real in the streets.
